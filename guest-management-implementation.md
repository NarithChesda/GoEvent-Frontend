# Guest Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Event Guest Management API into the EventInvitationTab component, replacing mock data with real API calls.

## API Integration

### Added to `src/services/api.ts`:
1. **Guest Types**:
   - `EventGuest` - Guest data structure with invitation status
   - `CreateGuestRequest` - Request structure for adding guests
   - `GuestListFilters` - Filters for searching/ordering guests
   - `GuestStats` - Statistics about guest list

2. **Guest Service Functions**:
   - `getGuests()` - List all guests with filtering
   - `getGuestStats()` - Get invitation statistics
   - `createGuest()` - Add new guest
   - `updateGuest()` - Update guest name
   - `deleteGuest()` - Remove guest
   - `markInvitationSent()` - Mark invitation as sent
   - `markInvitationViewed()` - Mark as viewed

## EventInvitationTab Component Updates

### Features Implemented:
1. **Real-time Guest Management**:
   - Add guests by name only
   - Delete guests with confirmation
   - Search guests by name with debounced API calls
   - Display invitation status (not_sent, sent, viewed)

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Total guests count
   - Sent invitations count
   - Viewed invitations count  
   - Not sent count
   - Loading states for all stats

3. **Showcase Link Management**:
   - Copy showcase link to clipboard
   - Display full URL on hover
   - Automatic URL generation from API response

4. **Payment Integration**:
   - Uses `usePaymentTemplateIntegration` composable
   - Shows different states:
     - No template selected
     - Template selected but not paid
     - Template activated (paid) - full access

5. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Loading states for all async operations
   - Search bar with live filtering
   - Status badges with color coding
   - Responsive table design
   - Action buttons for each guest

### Invitation Status Flow:
1. Guest added → Status: "not_sent"
2. Mark as sent → Status: "sent"
3. Guest views showcase → Status: "viewed" (automatic)

### API Error Handling:
- Graceful error messages for all operations
- Success notifications for completed actions
- Network error handling

## Usage Example:
```javascript
// Guest is added with status "not_sent"
await guestService.createGuest(eventId, { name: "John Doe" })

// Mark invitation as sent
await guestService.markInvitationSent(eventId, guestId)

// Copy showcase link
// Format: /api/events/{eventId}/showcase/?guest_name=John%20Doe&lang=en

// When guest visits the showcase link, status automatically updates to "viewed"
```

## Next Steps:
1. Implement bulk invitation sending
2. Add export guest list functionality
3. Add invitation email templates
4. Implement guest import from CSV/Excel
