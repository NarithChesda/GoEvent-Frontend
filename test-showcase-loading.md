# Event Showcase 3-Stage Loading System Test

## Implementation Summary

The event showcase page now has a properly implemented 3-stage loading system:

### Stage 1: Cover Stage
- âœ… **Cover Stage Detection**: Tracks when all cover stage assets are loaded
- âœ… **Background Preloading**: Starts preloading Stage 2 content when cover stage is ready
- âœ… **Envelope Button Logic**: Button is disabled until Stage 2 content (event video) is preloaded
- âœ… **Loading Indicator**: Shows loading spinner and progress while preloading Stage 2 content
- âœ… **Button States**: Visual feedback for disabled/enabled states with proper animations

### Stage 2: Event Video Stage
- âœ… **Immediate Playback**: Event video plays immediately when envelope is opened (because it's preloaded)
- âœ… **Stage 3 Preloading**: Starts preloading Stage 3 content (background video, photos) during video playback
- âœ… **Music Integration**: Auto-plays background music alongside the video
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles video loading failures

### Stage 3: Main Content Stage  
- âœ… **Smooth Transition**: Background video and photos are preloaded during Stage 2
- âœ… **Background Video**: Template background video plays immediately in Stage 3
- âœ… **Photo Gallery**: First 6 photos are preloaded for instant display

## Key Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Video Preloading
- Changed from `preload="metadata"` to `preload="auto"` for event videos
- Uses `canplaythrough` event to ensure enough data is loaded for smooth playback
- Extended timeout for full video preloading with fallback to metadata

### Smart Button Management
- `isEnvelopeButtonReady` computed property checks both cover stage readiness and Stage 2 content preload status
- Visual loading states with progress percentage
- Disabled state with proper opacity and cursor changes
- Maintains pulse animation only when ready

### Intelligent Preloading Strategy
1. **Stage 1â†’2 Preloading**: Critical content (event video, background video) preloaded in background
2. **Stage 2â†’3 Preloading**: During video playback, preloads remaining content (photos, assets)
3. **Priority-based**: Critical videos have higher priority than photos
4. **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent preloading to avoid overwhelming the browser

## Testing Scenarios

### Normal Flow
1. **Load Event Showcase**: Cover stage loads, assets are detected
2. **Background Preloading**: Event video starts preloading automatically  
3. **Button Enable**: Envelope button becomes clickable when video is ready
4. **Smooth Transition**: Opening envelope plays video immediately
5. **Stage 3 Ready**: Background content preloaded during video, smooth transition to main content

### Edge Cases
- **No Event Video**: Button enables after cover stage ready, skips to Stage 3 directly
- **Slow Connection**: Loading indicator shows progress, button stays disabled until ready
- **Video Load Failure**: Fallbacks handle errors gracefully, doesn't block progression
- **Data Saver Mode**: Respects user preferences and connection constraints

## Files Modified

1. **useBackgroundPreloader.ts**: Enhanced video preloading, added stage readiness checks
2. **useEventShowcase.ts**: Added envelope button readiness logic, Stage 3 preloading
3. **CoverStage.vue**: Integrated button disable/enable logic, loading states  
4. **EventShowcaseRefactored.vue**: Passed preloading props to components

## Console Logs for Debugging

The implementation includes comprehensive console logging:
- `ðŸŽ­ CoverStage: All assets loaded, stage ready for preloading`
- `âš¡ Starting background preloading...`
- `ðŸ“º Video metadata loaded for [url], waiting for canplaythrough...`
- `âœ… Stage 3: Preloaded video bg-video-[id]`
- `ðŸŽ¬ Starting Stage 3 preloading during video playback...`

These logs help developers track the preloading flow and identify any issues.
